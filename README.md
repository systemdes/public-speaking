> Everything I need for public speaking. 

Most of these pages are also on my personal site (in a more stylized format) but these are easy to grab and ready to use for other's to build upon.

## Templates
I've written a whole guide on public speaking. Here are templates you can use for yourself based on those guidelines.

* [Speaker (inclusive) Rider Template](/templates/rider.md)
* [Questions for event organizers](/templates/questionnaire.md)
* [Proposal Template](/templates/proposal-template.md)
* [Talk checklist](/templates/talk-checklist.md)

## Call for papers (finished talks)

* [Learn how to learn](/cfp/learn-to-learn.md)

### Not currently submitting (but could be delivered)

## Resources
You can copy-and-paste these texts and resources for use on social media or your website. If you need additional information, feel free to contact me.
